The kingdom of Lali has lived peacefully for years. One day a dark shape
covered the sky. The villagers of Lali looked up when the shape let out
a loud roar. It was a dragon! Dragons are known for their greed and 
violence so the King and Queen summoned their bravest knights together. 
The knights led a valiant attack against the dragon but were unsuccessful.
As a squire you were not part of the first attack, however, now you want
to help. You decide to go into town.

Welcome to Dragonslayer!
There are four items necessary to slay the dragon and the villagers are
the key to gaining these items. Once you choose to slay the dragon there
is no going back.
